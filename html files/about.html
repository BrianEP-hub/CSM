					<h3>Who are we?</h3>
					<p>We are the community science museum. We believe that science should be accessible for everyone, our aim is to create a space where everyone can experience the wonders of our discoveries and ignite a spark for a lifelong passion to continue exploring the world around us!</p>
					<p>We belive that science shouldn't be confined to textbooks, but brought to life through exibits!</p>
					<p>This is why we have over 1000 different exibits on the many varied subjects of science for you to explore!</p>
					<p>Many of our exibits are designed for you to interact and play around with to see science come to life.</p>
					<p>If by some magical way you are to be trapped in after hours you will get the benefit of exploring our dinosaur exibit come to life. (we dont know why this happens, but they seem to roam around and do most of the moving work for us)</p>

					<h3>Work at the museum?</h3>
					<h4>Volunteer</h4>
					<p>A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays in good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy. Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.</p>
					<p>You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact us if you’d like to find out more about how you can get involved.
					</p>
