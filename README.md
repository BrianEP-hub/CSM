# CSM
CSM stands for Community Science Museum

It is a project I am working on, and the "museum" is only fictional and will only exist in the degree of a website I am developing

The programming languages I will be using are HTML5 and CSS3. This will set a nice base future development of this project but as of now
no other languages will be used.

Images are provided from a project folder that has been provided for me from my School.
